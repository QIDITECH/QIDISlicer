# In QIDISlicer 1.2.0 we switched from https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg to its fork https://github.com/fltk/nanosvg
# because this last implements the new function nsvgRasterizeXY() which we now use in GLTexture::load_from_svg()
# for rasterizing svg files from their original size to a squared power of two texture on Windows systems using
# AMD Radeon graphics cards
